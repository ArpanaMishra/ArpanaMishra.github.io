Selective Reject ARQ Simulation

This simulation project has been designed in Adobe Animate CC2015.2. There were not any known or detected bugs at the time of submission.

*************************************************************************************************************************************
The Simulation is divided into five scenarios as follows :

1. Perfect Communication : This demonstartes the communication of frames from sender to receiver and the acknowledgement in the form of RR from receiver to the sender.

2. Damaged and Buffered Frame : In this part the frame 4 is lost or damaged before reaching the receiver. The frames 5 and 6 are successfully accepted by the receiver but they are stored in a buffer at its end. As soon as receiver receives frame 5 it notifies sender that frame 4 is missing by sending SREJ 4. The sender re-sends the frame 4 and the frame 5 & 6 are retrieved from buffer to be put in order after 4. 

3. Damaged and Cumulative RR : This part of the simulation considers the case of missing/damaged RR. The acknowledgement sent from the Receiver upon accepting the frame/s gets lost. The receiver sends RR4 to the sender to confirm that it has received till Frame 3 and is now ready for Frame 4. The acknowledgment gets lost in the communication but the receiver sends the RR6 upon accepting frame 5 implying that it has successfully received all the frames till Frame 5. The receiver need not send RR's for any frame before frame 6.

4. Damaged RR and Timeout :  This part of the simulation also considers the case of missing/damaged RR but it does not receive a cumulative RR. The sender waits for a set time for acnowledgement from the receiver end. When it does not receive any acknowledgement till the set time then it sends RR P bit=1 to check the status of sent frames. In this simulation, the RR4 sent by the receiver gets lost. The sender waits for 5 seconds and then sends a RR P bit-1 request asking receiver to let it know which frame to be sent next.
The receiver responds with RR6 as the cumulative RR. The sender sends frame 6 and the communication continues.

5. Damaged Frame and Damaged REJ :The scenario is an extension to Damaged and Buffered Frame scenario. The frame 4 is sent from sender but is lost. The receiver sends SREJ 4 notifying the same upon receiving frame 5 but this packet is also lost. The receiver buffers frame 5 and 6 and sender waits for confirmation. After waiting for 5 seconds it sends RR P bit=1 to the receiver. The Receiver responds by RR4. The sender sends RR4 and in the mean time receiver sends RR7 as Frames 5 and 6 are already accepted.

Enjoy!
